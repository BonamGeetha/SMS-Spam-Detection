# SMS-Spam-Classifier

1. Data Collection and Preparation:

Dataset:
A labeled dataset is crucial, containing SMS messages marked as either "spam" or "ham." Common datasets are publicly available.
Data Preprocessing:
This stage cleans and transforms the text data into a format suitable for machine learning. Steps typically include:
Text Cleaning: Removing punctuation, special characters, and unnecessary whitespace.
Lowercasing: Converting all text to lowercase.
Stop Word Removal: Eliminating common words (e.g., "the," "a," "is") that don't contribute much to meaning.
Tokenization: Splitting the text into individual words or tokens.
Stemming/Lemmatization: Reducing words to their root form.


2. Feature Extraction:

Vectorization:
Machine learning models require numerical input, so text data must be converted into numerical vectors. Common techniques include:
CountVectorizer: Counts the occurrences of each word in the text.
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): Assigns weights to words based on their frequency in a message and their rarity across the entire dataset.


3. Model Selection and Training:

Machine Learning Algorithms:
Several algorithms are suitable for text classification, including:
Naive Bayes: A probabilistic algorithm often effective for text data.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): A powerful algorithm for classification.
Logistic Regression: A linear model for binary classification.
Deep learning models (like LSTM's) are also used for more complex systems.
Training:
The chosen algorithm is trained on the prepared dataset, learning patterns that distinguish spam from ham.
Model Evaluation:
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as:
Accuracy: The overall percentage of correct predictions.
Precision: The proportion of correctly predicted spam messages.
Recall: The proportion of actual spam messages correctly identified.
F1-score: A balanced measure of precision and recall.
Confusion Matrices.


4. Implementation:

Python Libraries:
Key libraries used in this type of project include:
Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and text processing.
Pandas: For data manipulation.
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): For text preprocessing.
Tensorflow/Keras: For deep learning models.
